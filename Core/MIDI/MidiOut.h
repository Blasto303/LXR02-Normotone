/*
 * MidiOut - everything the LXR transmits (S083).
 *
 * What: the only module that writes to the DIN and USB ports. It frames
 * messages for each port (USB: cable 0 and the correct code index for
 * channel, system-common, SysEx and realtime messages), forwards received
 * messages per MRT, sends LXR-generated realtime, note, program-change,
 * Bank-change and parameter messages under the TXF filter, keeps one
 * note-off record per track, and (Phase G) suppresses echoes and coalesces
 * parameter output.
 * Why: plan 3.1/3.9. Before S083 the sequencer and the parser each wrote
 * the ports, USB system messages used code index = status >> 4 (wrong for
 * SPP and SysEx), and the note-off cache was one note per channel, so two
 * tracks on one channel could leave a hanging note.
 * Context: foreground and TIM3 (sequencer notes, clock, realtime
 * forwarding). Every port write runs under the driver's PRIMASK section.
 * RAM: per-track note-off 14 B (R-B); Phase G adds 8 B.
 * Affiliates: MidiDin.c, usb_manager.c, MidiIn.c (configuration),
 * sequencer.c, MidiTransport.c, MidiNoteMap.c (G).

 * Context: TIM3 and foreground. The previous note-off, the note-on and the
 * record update run as one PRIMASK section, so concurrent triggers of one
 * track cannot leave a note hanging downstream (S083 assessment F-2).

 * pitch has no note on the track's range nothing is sent (the previous
