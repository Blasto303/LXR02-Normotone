/*
 * MidiNoteMap - note <-> (track, internal note) for one Scene (S083,
 * plan 3.3, MIDI_SPEC 4.1).
 *
 * What: resolves a received (channel, note) to at most one track and the
 * internal note the voice plays, and the inverse for transmit. Rules:
 *  1. assigned ranges: a track with a note owns [note, next assigned - 1]
 *     (or 127), internal = 63 + (n - note); on equal notes the lower track
 *     owns the range and the other owns nothing;
 *  2. below the lowest assigned note (all of 0..127 if none), the channel's
 *     unassigned tracks share the notes: on G a stripe (n mod |U|, default
 *     pitch), on another channel contiguous near-equal blocks in track
 *     order (lower tracks take the remainder), chromatic from each block
 *     start;
 *  3. one voice per note; 4. internal notes clamp at 127 (+64).
 * A track's effective channel is its own channel, else G; a track set
 * explicitly to G's number follows the G rules; with G off unassigned
 * tracks have no channel. S083 follow-up (user 2026-10-22): a track whose
 * channel is `off` has no channel at all; a track whose note is `off` keeps
 * its channel (for CC/NRPN/PC) but takes no part in the note map, so it
 * receives no notes and sends none.
 * Why: N1-N5. Stateless and table-free: at most seven tracks per lookup,
 * no RAM. The pure functions take a settings snapshot, so the host test
 * (tools/midi_test/) links this file alone (MIDI_NOTEMAP_HOST_TEST).
 * Affiliates: MidiNotes (receive), MidiOut (transmit, Phase G),
 * MidiControl/MidiProgram/MidiLearn (tracks on a channel).
