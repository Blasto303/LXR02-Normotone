/*
 * MidiNotes - what a received note does (S083, plan 3.4, N6, C8).
 *
 * What: resolves a note-on/off through the active Scene's note map, then
 * either triggers the track once at the note's velocity and pitch, or,
 * when the BAR overlay is on (set by BAR `<`/`>` in PERF or by CC2 on G),
 * performs that overlay's action through the per-track overlay executor.
 * Reports each single trigger to LiveRecord with the note's arrival age.
 * CC2 sets the PERF BAR overlay itself (buttonHandler_setOverlay()); this
 * module keeps no separate CC2 state (S083 follow-up).
 * Why: N1-N6; Q5 (concurrent rolls per track); Q6 (arrival time).
 * Context: foreground (midiIn_dispatch()).
 * RAM: none (the former 1 B CC2 state is retired). Held notes and the
 * overlay state live in buttonHandler.c.
 * Affiliates: MidiNoteMap, buttonHandler overlay executor, sequencer
 * (seq_triggerVoice(), seq_isTrackMuted()), LiveRecord, MidiIn.

 * 2 BAR `>` overlay. Sets the PERF BAR overlay exactly like a BAR press:
 * the BAR LEDs follow in PERF, panel VOICE triggers and received notes use
 * it, and held overlays re-configure. The value persists until the next
 * CC2 or BAR press (last one wins); off at boot. Output: 1 consumed (0..2),
 * 0 other values (ignored and forwarded). Accessor: midiControl_handleCc()
 * (G-only check there).
